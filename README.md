# DESTROY EVERYTHING!

This is a vertical scrolling shooter based on the tutorial by [Mike Thomas](https://github.com/mikethomas)
from [atomicrobotdesign.com](http://atomicrobotdesign.com).

You can find his tutorial [here](http://atomicrobotdesign.com/blog/htmlcss/build-a-vertical-scrolling-shooter-game-with-html5-canvas-part-1/).

I am also using HTML5 Boilerplate whose license is included.
